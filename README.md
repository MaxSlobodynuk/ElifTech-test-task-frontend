I developed both the frontend and backend for a web application designed for event registration management. 
On the frontend, using React, I implemented an events board page that displays a paginated list of available events.
On the backend, using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, I implemented event data processing and user registration. 
The registration form collects user data and stores it in the database via a REST API.
Technologies: React, Node.js, Express, REST API, MongoDB.
